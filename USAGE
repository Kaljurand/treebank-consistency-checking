Sentence 42:

There is "PNC PNC PNC" --> NP
Should be: "PNC PNC PNC" -> MPN

Check with:

./consistency.pl --key edge

or even better:

./consistency.pl --key word 

-----

Sentence 3:

There is: "PTKZU VVINF" -->  VP
Should be: "PTKZU VVINF" -->  VZ

And this happens twice.

Check with:

./consistency.pl --key edge

or:

./consistency.pl --key pos

-----

Sentence 60:

There is: "KOKOM NN" --> OA2
Should be: "KOKOM NN" --> MO

Check with:

./consistency.pl --key pos --value edge

----

Sentence 263 (this I didn't modify):

There is "PTKZU VVINF" -->  OC
Mostly this is grouped as: HD

Check with:

./consistency.pl --key pos --value edge

or even better:

./consistency.pl --key pos --value edge --lc 4 --rc 4
